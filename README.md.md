# ANIMAL IMAGE CLASSIFICATION PROJECT
Nikita Jain

## Description of Project
This Project is to Classify Animal Images Using Machine Learning. We have used Five Categories in this project: Cat, Horse, Elephant, Cow, Chicken. Data came from Animals-10 dataset in kaggle.
## Purpose
Classify species of animals based on pictures. Can automatically help identify animals
in the wild taken by wildlife conservatories. Can lead to discoveries of potential new
habitat as well as new unseen species of animals within the same class.
## Final Model
In this project, two models are used:VGG-16 and CNN. The highest accuracy is 96%. For execution, upload any image then choose the model you want to use. Model will classify the image on basis of its training. Now you can see the predicted name of the animal.

## Conclusion
This model can excellently guess a picture of an animal if the shape of the animal is in
the training method. To train it in additional animals, simply feed it labeled images (1000
at least for training and 300+ for validation). Also, just for fun, you can also give the
machine a picture of a pokemon like Rapidash and it will guess it is a horse.
