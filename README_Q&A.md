# Important Interview Questions & Answers on TensorFlow Image Classification Project

### 1. What is the purpose of `ImageDataGenerator` in Keras?  
**Answer:**  
It generates batches of tensor image data with real-time data augmentation to help prevent overfitting.

### 2. Why do we use `rescale=1/255.` in the `ImageDataGenerator`?  
**Answer:**  
To normalize pixel values from [0, 255] to [0, 1], which improves model convergence.

### 3. What does `validation_split=0.15` do?  
**Answer:**  
It reserves 15% of the dataset for validation while training on the remaining 85%.

### 4. How does `flow_from_directory` work?  
**Answer:**  
It reads images from a directory organized by class subfolders and generates batches with labels.

### 5. Why is `shuffle=True` used in the training generator?  
**Answer:**  
To ensure the training data is mixed randomly each epoch for better generalization.

### 6. Why freeze layers in the pre-trained model?  
**Answer:**  
To keep learned features intact and only fine-tune later layers to adapt to the new task, saving training time and avoiding overfitting.

### 7. What is transfer learning?  
**Answer:**  
Using a pre-trained model on a large dataset (like ImageNet) and adapting it to a new but related task.

### 8. Why use `GlobalAveragePooling2D` instead of `Flatten`?  
**Answer:**  
It reduces overfitting and model size by averaging spatial features instead of flattening all.

### 9. Why add a `Dropout` layer?  
**Answer:**  
To randomly drop neurons during training to reduce overfitting.

### 10. What is the role of the final Dense layer with `softmax` activation?  
**Answer:**  
To output class probabilities for multi-class classification.

### 11. Why choose `categorical_crossentropy` as the loss function?  
**Answer:**  
Because the task involves multi-class classification with one-hot encoded labels.

### 12. What optimizer is used and why?  
**Answer:**  
Adam optimizer is used for adaptive learning rate and faster convergence.

### 13. Why set a low learning rate (0.0001)?  
**Answer:**  
To fine-tune the pre-trained layers gently without large updates.

### 14. What is the purpose of `ModelCheckpoint` callback?  
**Answer:**  
To save the best model weights during training based on validation loss.

### 15. What does the `EarlyStopping` callback do?  
**Answer:**  
It stops training early if validation loss doesnâ€™t improve for a set number of epochs to avoid overfitting.

### 16. How is the model evaluated during training?  
**Answer:**  
Using validation data and metrics like accuracy and loss.

### 17. How do you predict classes on new images?  
**Answer:**  
Load and preprocess the image, expand dimensions, and call `model.predict()` followed by `argmax`.

### 18. Why resize images to 224x224?  
**Answer:**  
Because VGG16 expects 224x224 input size.

### 19. Why is preprocessing required before prediction?  
**Answer:**  
To scale pixels and normalize input as expected by the pre-trained model.

### 20. What is the difference between training and validation generators?  
**Answer:**  
Training generator applies augmentation and shuffling; validation generator usually does not.

### 21. What does `np.argmax` do in predictions?  
**Answer:**  
It selects the class with the highest predicted probability.

### 22. Why call `model.save()` after training?  
**Answer:**  
To save the trained model for later use or deployment.

### 23. What is the significance of `class_mode='categorical'`?  
**Answer:**  
Indicates labels are one-hot encoded vectors for multi-class classification.

### 24. How does data augmentation help?  
**Answer:**  
It artificially increases dataset diversity and reduces overfitting.

### 25. Why use both `train_generator` and `val_generator` from the same directory?  
**Answer:**  
To split data automatically into training and validation sets based on `subset` parameter.

### 26. How can you visualize training progress?  
**Answer:**  
By plotting accuracy and loss curves over epochs using matplotlib.

### 27. How do you interpret the classification report?  
**Answer:**  
It shows precision, recall, f1-score for each class, helpful for model evaluation.

### 28. What are common metrics used for image classification?  
**Answer:**  
Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

### 29. Why might you freeze all but last few layers?  
**Answer:**  
Because initial layers learn generic features; last layers adapt to the new dataset.

### 30. How to handle imbalanced classes in such projects?  
**Answer:**  
Use class weights, oversampling, or more data augmentation for minority classes.

# Important Questions and Answers on Anvil + Colab + TensorFlow Integration

---

### 1. What is the purpose of `anvil-uplink` in this notebook, and how does it facilitate communication between Colab and an Anvil app?

**Answer:**  
`anvil-uplink` is a Python package that allows you to connect your Python environment (in this case, Google Colab) to an Anvil app via a secure connection. It enables you to run backend Python code remotely and call functions from the Anvil front-end (web UI). This setup allows the Colab environment to serve as a backend server that processes requests (like image classification) coming from the Anvil client app.

---

### 2. How does the function `prediksi(img)` preprocess an image before passing it to the model for prediction, and why is this preprocessing necessary?

**Answer:**  
The `prediksi(img)` function performs these preprocessing steps:  
- Resizes the image to 224x224 pixels, which is the expected input size for the model.  
- Converts the image into a NumPy array and expands its dimensions to add a batch size dimension (`np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0)`), since the model expects batches of images.  
- Applies MobileNetV2-specific preprocessing (`preprocess_input`), which scales pixel values and applies normalization as expected by the pretrained model.  

These steps are necessary to ensure that the input image matches the input format, size, and pixel distribution that the model was trained on, leading to accurate predictions.

### 3. Explain the use of `@anvil.server.callable` decorator. How does it enable remote procedure calls from the Anvil front-end to the Colab backend?

**Answer:**  
The `@anvil.server.callable` decorator marks a Python function as callable from the Anvil client app. When the Anvil front-end calls this function, the request is sent to the connected Python backend (Colab in this case) over the `anvil-uplink` connection. The backend executes the function and returns the result to the client. This mechanism allows the frontend UI to trigger backend logic such as running the model prediction without exposing the code or model directly on the client side.

### 4. Why is the model loaded from Google Drive using `load_model('/content/drive/MyDrive/vgg_model.h5')` and how can you ensure the model file path is correctly accessible during runtime?

**Answer:**  
The model is loaded from Google Drive to persist the trained weights and architecture outside of the ephemeral Colab session, allowing reuse without retraining. Mounting Google Drive (`drive.mount('/content/drive')`) provides access to stored files in the user's Drive account. To ensure the model path is correct during runtime:  
- The Drive must be mounted successfully before accessing the file.  
- The exact file path must match the Drive's folder structure.  
- The file should be uploaded to the specified Drive location prior to running the notebook.

### 5. In the `classify_image(file)` function, why is the image converted using `anvil.media.TempFile(file)` and how is the image passed from Anvil to the TensorFlow model for classification?

**Answer:**  
`anvil.media.TempFile(file)` is used to create a temporary local file from the media object received from the Anvil client. This step is necessary because the uploaded file from Anvil is not a normal file but a special media object. Converting it to a temp file allows the use of standard Python libraries (like PIL) to open and process the image. The image is then converted to a NumPy array and passed to the `prediksi(img)` function, which preprocesses the image and feeds it into the TensorFlow model to get the predicted class.
